        Music

        <h4>I love most types of music, but my favorites include Jazz, Classic Rock, and R&B.<br />
        <br />
        I have sung for most of my life in one choir or another. I was even given credit for participating
        on an album my church produced. I did harmony backup vocals. It is an awsome worship CD called <i>Season of Praise</i>.
        Check it out <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001BQOHRY/ref=ntt_mus_dp_dpt_1" target="_blank">here</a> to listen to some sound clips.
        <br /><br />
        Music has always been part of my life.
        I've tried out many instruments over the years, but none appeal to me as much as percussion. I call drums my soul instrument.
        I love rhythm's paradoxical qualities of complexity and simplicity. Rhythm is foundational, strong, and supportive.
        Without rhythm, there is no music, no life. As with any foundation, if it crumbles, so does everything else.

        Photography
      </h1>
      <p class="description">
        <h4>I have enjoyed photography since I was a kid. My first photo was of a sailboat on a lake
        at camp one summer when I was about eight years old. <br />
        I took photography in eighth grade and became the photographer for the school paper (grades 8-10).
        This included developing those photos in the darkroom.<br /><br />
        After college, I took continuing ed courses at IUPUI and gained a certificate in
        photography, which also included work in the darkroom.<br />
        Later, I built a darkroom in my bathroom. A friend of mine, from a local photographer's group, and I, developed a
        photo that won "best of show" in the Indiana State Fair. My own color photo was hung
        in that show. Just to have your work hung was an honor as not many made it that far.<br />
        Although my darkroom is no more, I still enjoy photography. My favorite subjects include
        mostly nature shots. <br /><br />
        The carousel below shows all flowers, but I like other nature shots, as well. <br />
        Mostly natural formations such as the sky, clouds, and landscapes.<br />
        I also love architecture. The clean lines and how they interact with a structure's surroundings, can be
        a beautiful thing.
