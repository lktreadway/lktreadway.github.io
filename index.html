      <h4>
        Programming is like putting puzzle pieces together. <br />
        I love the structure, creativity, and challenge of putting systems and code together that solve problems
        and provide value to clients.<br />
        Creative hobbies like art, music, and writing, may make me more well-rounded, but they only fulfill
        one aspect of my personality. Programming satisfies my creative side and my logical, problem-solving side. I consider programming the perfect
        blend of left and right brain thinking.<br /><br />

      <h4>
        I tend to be too humble, which makes selling myself to prospective employers
        difficult. But, I try to convey that I do what I do because I enjoy it. Because
        it is fun. If I create or finish anything, it is not to gain recognition,
        although that’s nice too, but because I either want to challenge myself or
        just like doing what I do. I have always counted myself as blessed to enjoy my job. Not many do.<br />
        Accomplishments define a person and their character.
        So, as you peruse this page, I hope it helps you get to know me a little better.

      <h4>
        Most of my hobbies are creative in nature. Probably because that is the
        core of my nature, as well as, the energy that drives these activities.
        In fact, everything I do has an element of fun to it, including programming. <br />

        This page is a compendium of programming resources I’ve accumulated so far.
        I hope it will help other programmers, my collegues, and myself, as we
        daily create code and solve problems. I really just wanted to have a
        convenient reference at my finger tips. If you have any additions to
        propose, please <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>. I can’t add everything,
        but if I find it useful, I’ll gratefully add it to my list.
